Making high end research more accessible


This is an application that aimst to bring high end research to the general public in a way that doesnt make the feel like they have to get a degree in that field to understand it.

Picture this: 

It is 2024 and mankind is closer to exploring the universe like never before. Gigantic discoeries in physics, chemistry, and all the science have been made within the last few months and we are all  collectively looking for the next big thing to put us on the path to become an interplanetary species.

Except theere is one problem, 

You do not know any of these things first hand and they have all been passed down to you via news networks. The worst part is, these discoveries have been selected by news networks for the sole purpose of getting massive view numbers. 

You then decide to go on an adventure out of curiosity to understand the latest discoveries that are not mainstream only to be confronted with the lengthiest research report ever known to man, all full of buzzwords and scientific jargon that makes understanding the paper really difficult

Plus you're just in 8th grade.


This is where redox comes in!


Redox is a software application utilizing Google's Gemini AI model to break down high end complex scentific literature to anyone with teh ability to read and write, in bits that are understandable to anyone outside from any educational level and any industry.
